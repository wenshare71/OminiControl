## Features

OminiControl is a minimal yet powerful universal control framework for Diffusion Transformer models like [FLUX](https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux).

* **Universal Control 🌐**:  A unified control framework that supports both subject-driven control and spatial control (such as edge-guided and in-painting generation).

* **Minimal Design 🚀**: Injects control signals while preserving original model structure. Only introduces 0.1% additional parameters to the base model.

## News
- **2026-07-02**: Codebase updated for `diffusers` 0.38. `generate()` gains a `condition_scale` argument to adjust condition strength, subject-driven generation now works on `FLUX.1-dev` (see [example](./examples/subject_dev.ipynb)), and OminiControl2's KV-cache fast inference (`kv_cache=True`) is now documented (see [Usage example](#usage-example)).
- **2025-05-12**: ⭐️ The code of [OminiControl2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08280) is released. It introduces a new efficient conditioning method for diffusion transformers. (Check out the training code [here](./train)).
- **2025-05-12**: Support custom style LoRA. (Check out the [example](./examples/combine_with_style_lora.ipynb)).
- **2025-04-09**: ⭐️ [OminiControl Art](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Yuanshi/OminiControl_Art) is released. It can stylize any image with an artistic style. (Check out the [demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Yuanshi/OminiControl_Art) and [inference examples](./examples/ominicontrol_art.ipynb)).
- **2024-12-26**: Training code is released. Now you can create your own OminiControl model by customizing any control tasks (3D, multi-view, pose-guided, try-on, etc.) with the FLUX model. Check the [training folder](./train) for more details.

## Quick Start
### Setup (Optional)
1. **Environment setup**
```bash
conda create -n omini python=3.12
conda activate omini
```
2. **Torch installation** (pick the index URL matching your CUDA version)
```bash
pip install torch==2.8.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```
3. **Requirements installation**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Usage example
1. Subject-driven generation: `examples/subject.ipynb` (on `FLUX.1-dev`: `examples/subject_dev.ipynb`)
2. Subject-driven generation at 1024x1024: `examples/subject_1024.ipynb` (best quality with the 1024-trained model)
3. In-painting: `examples/inpainting.ipynb`
4. Canny edge to image, depth to image, colorization, deblurring: `examples/spatial.ipynb`
5. Combining with a custom style LoRA: `examples/combine_with_style_lora.ipynb`
6. Image stylization (OminiControl Art): `examples/ominicontrol_art.ipynb`

> **Note (multiple LoRAs):** if you load more than one adapter via repeated `pipe.load_lora_weights(..., adapter_name=...)` calls, activate them explicitly with `pipe.set_adapters(["adapter_a", "adapter_b"])` — otherwise only the last-loaded adapter stays active and the others are silently ignored. See `examples/spatial.ipynb` for the pattern.

#### Adjusting condition strength
`generate()` accepts a `condition_scale` argument (default `1.0`, which reproduces the original behavior exactly). Values `> 1` strengthen the condition image's influence, values `< 1` weaken it, and `0` suppresses it entirely.
```python
result = generate(pipe, prompt=prompt, conditions=[condition], condition_scale=1.3)
```

#### Faster generation with KV-cache (OminiControl2)
Pass `kv_cache=True` to `generate()` to compute the condition branch's keys/values once and reuse them across all remaining steps (~1.5x end-to-end speedup at 8 steps). This requires a LoRA trained with `independent_condition: true` — see [Efficient Generation (OminiControl2)](./train/README.md#efficient-generation-ominicontrol2).

### Guidelines for subject-driven generation
1. Center-crop and resize your input image to the model's native resolution (512x512 for `subject`/`subject_512`, 1024x1024 for `subject_1024_beta`) before passing it in — the pipeline does not do this automatically. See the example notebooks for the preprocessing code.
2. When writing prompts, refer to the subject using phrases like `this item`, `the object`, or `it`. e.g.
   1. *A close up view of this item. It is placed on a wooden table.*
   2. *A young lady is wearing this shirt.*
3. The model primarily works with objects rather than human subjects currently, due to the absence of human data in training.

> The subject LoRAs were trained on `FLUX.1-dev`. When running them on `FLUX.1-dev`, enable real image guidance (`image_guidance_scale > 1.0`, keep `guidance_scale=3.5`) — see `examples/subject_dev.ipynb`. They also run on `FLUX.1-schnell` (as in the example notebooks), where no image guidance is needed.

> `subject_1024_beta` was trained at 1024x1024 and gives its best results at that resolution. The weight currently lives in a non-main revision of the HF repo — pass `revision=` when loading it (see `examples/subject_1024.ipynb`).

## Limitations
1. The model's subject-driven generation primarily works with objects rather than human subjects due to the absence of human data in training.
2. The subject-driven LoRAs were trained on `FLUX.1-dev`. When running them on `FLUX.1-dev`, you must use real image guidance: call `generate(...)` with `image_guidance_scale > 1.0` (e.g. `1.5`) and more steps (~20–28) — without it, `FLUX.1-dev` tends to ignore the condition. `image_guidance_scale` is the tunable CFG knob; the distilled `guidance_scale` must be kept at `3.5` (the value used in training, for train/inference consistency — it is not a free hyperparameter). See `examples/subject_dev.ipynb`. On `FLUX.1-schnell` (as in the example notebooks), no image guidance is needed.
3. The `subject`/`subject_512` and spatial LoRAs were trained at 512x512 and work best at that resolution; `subject_1024_beta` was trained at 1024x1024 and gives its best results there (see `examples/subject_1024.ipynb`). Non-square resolutions (e.g. 512x768) also work.

## Training
Training instructions can be found in this [folder](./train).
